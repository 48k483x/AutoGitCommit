## Features

- **Automated Commits**: Set it and forget it! Commit changes to your repo automatically.
- **Customizable**: Easily modify the script to adjust the number of commits or the message.
- **Easy Setup**: With just a few steps, you're ready to go.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Git installed on your machine.
- A GitHub repository.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AutoGitCommit.git
```
2. Navigate to the cloned repository:

```bash
cd AutoGitCommit
```
3. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x commits.sh
```
### Usage

Run the script within your Git repository:
```bash
./commits.sh
```


## How It Works

AutoGitCommit works by adding an "a" to a `COMMITS.md` file, committing the change with a specific message, and then pushing it to your remote repository. It repeats this process a specified number of times (default is 100).

## Customization

You can edit `AutoGitCommit.sh` to change the number of commits or modify the commit message according to your preference.

## Caution

- Use responsibly: Frequent and automated commits might be considered spammy by some services.
- Ensure you have permission to push to the repository.

## :warning: Important Disclaimer: Ensuring Your Contributions Count

To make sure your contributions using `AutoGitCommit` are accurately reflected on your GitHub contributions graph, please ensure the following steps are carefully followed:

### :email: Email Configuration
Commits are associated with your GitHub profile based on the email address used for commits. Ensure the email address set in your Git configuration is linked to your GitHub account. You can link multiple email addresses to your GitHub account by visiting the **Settings > Emails** section of your GitHub profile.

### :white_check_mark: Verify Your Email Address
After adding an email address to your GitHub account, you must verify it. GitHub will send a verification email to the address you added. Click the verification link within this email to confirm that you own the email address.

### :lock: Consider Email Privacy Settings
If you have enabled email privacy in your GitHub settings, ensure that the commits are made using the private email address provided by GitHub (`username@users.noreply.github.com`). This email is used to associate your commits with your GitHub account while keeping your actual email address private.

### :heavy_check_mark: Include Private Contributions (Optional)
If you're making commits to a private repository and wish for these contributions to appear on your GitHub profile, enable the "Include private contributions on my profile" option in the GitHub profile settings.

By ensuring these settings are correctly configured, you'll help guarantee that your contributions are properly showcased on your GitHub profile's contributions graph.
